1. install NDK, CMake, LLDB components.(only once for all projects with Native code)
2. Create New Project and choose "Include C++ Support" checkbox.
    after Step 2, (1) it will create "cpp" folder and on cpp file under "app/src/main/" folder.
                  (2) it will create CMakeLists.txt under "app/" folder.
                  (3) it will add below configurations in build.grade(Module:app)
                                externalNativeBuild {
                                    cmake {
                                        cppFlags ""
                                    }
                                }
                                externalNativeBuild {
                                    cmake {
                                        path "CMakeLists.txt"
                                    }
                                }
3. make sure local.properties file include below path:
    ndk.dir=/home/eleven/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle

/**
*  if you want to enable NDK in a old project, which didn't choose support C++ when create, you need do above 3 items
   and  also do below actions:

    1. configuration in build.gradle(Module:app)
       sourceSets {
           main {
               jni.srcDirs = ['src/main/cpp/']
           }
       }
    2. build to generate .h file & ad cpp file, and its build rule.
        (1) cd "app/src/main/java" folder.
        (2) javah -jni com.htc.eleven.multimediatesttool.NDKDemoActivity
        (3) cp com_htc_eleven_multimediatesttool_NDKDemoActivity.h to "app/src/main/cpp" folder.
        (4) touch to create native.cpp, include below .h file and implements code interfaces.
        (5) add build rules in CMakeLists.txt

    3. if so we want to build is dependent on other binary so lib.
        (1) add build dependency in build.gradle(Module:app)

            sourceSets {
                main {
                    jniLibs.srcDirs = ['src/main/jniLibs']
                }
            }
        (2)  add dependency in CMakeLists.txt. // for example, we need libbdEASRAndroid.so.
            target_link_libraries(wakeup
                                  bdEASRAndroid
                                  ${log-lib}
                                  )

            set(libs_include_DIR src/main/cpp)
            set(libs_DIR src/main/jniLibs/${ANDROID_ABI})
