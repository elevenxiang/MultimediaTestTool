Steps to use 3rd modules and libs:

1. use zip download or git clone to download 3rd module source code from Github.
2. "File" -> "New" -> "Import Module"
    (1) choose the "library" folder.
    (2) rename lib/module folder name.
3. modify "build.gradle" new created folder at step (2), to modify sdk version information to be the same as current project.

        compileSdkVersion 26
        buildToolsVersion "26.0.1"

	    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.htc.eleven.multimediatesttool"
        minSdkVersion 24
        targetSdkVersion 26
4. right click on current "app" -> "Open Module Settings" -> choose tab "Dependencies" -> click "+" -> "3 Module Dependency" -> choose added module
   just right now. and it will modify build.gradle and settings.gradle to include support of 3rd module.

5. re-build project, and fix build break.
